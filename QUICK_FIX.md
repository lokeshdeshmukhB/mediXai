# âœ… GROQ MODEL FIXED!

## What Was Fixed

The Groq model `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` was decommissioned. All controllers have been updated to use the new model: **`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`**

## Files Updated

âœ… `backend/controllers/chat.controller.js`
âœ… `backend/controllers/quiz.controller.js`
âœ… `backend/controllers/summarizer.controller.js`
âœ… `backend/controllers/interaction.controller.js`

## How to Restart

### Option 1: If Backend is Running
1. Stop the backend server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Restart it:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Fresh Start
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Test the Fix

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Login or create an account
3. Navigate to **AI Assistant** (Chatbot)
4. Send a message like: "What are ACE inhibitors?"
5. You should get a proper AI response! âœ¨

## What to Expect

- âœ… Chat should work perfectly
- âœ… Quiz generation should work
- âœ… Paper summarization should work
- âœ… Drug interaction checking should work

## If You Still See Errors

1. **Check your Groq API Key:**
   - Make sure it's valid in `backend/.env`
   - Verify at https://console.groq.com/

2. **Check API Quota:**
   - You might have hit rate limits
   - Check your Groq console for usage

3. **Clear Node Cache:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Additional Info

- New model is **faster** and **more capable**
- See `backend/GROQ_MODELS.md` for model details
- All features remain the same
